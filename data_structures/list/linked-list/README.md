# linked list
    - ds
    - implements list

## about
    Collection of nodes randomly stored in memory, each node contains data stored and pointer to next node.
    Last node points to null.
    If an element is added when theres no memory or stack spaces left the stack overflows.
### adv/disadv
    - items dont need to be stored contiguously in memory, so can spacefully be put anywhere is memory
    - since memory allocated dynamically, dont need to declare size beforehand
    - generally takes longer to access/insert/del elements than a array

## operations
- insert at beginning
- insert at end
- insert after specific node
- del a beginning
- del at end
- del after specific node
- traverse
- search

# todo
- add psedocode for ds variation
